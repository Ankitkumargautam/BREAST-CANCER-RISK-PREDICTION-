Breast cancer risks can be reduced via early detection of the disease; according to the American Cancer Society (2007) early detection of breast cancer risks can help reduce the possibility of mitigating the full growth of tumors.The goal is to find the optimized decision boundaries to predict the breast cancer at the earlier stage.

According to WHO (2002) cancer has been responsible for the deaths of millions of people worldwide with an estimated increase of 50% for developing countries and for 70% of the total deaths due to cancer.

The American Cancer Society (2008) defines cancer as a generic term for a large group of diseases that can affect any part of the body; other terms are malignant tumors and neoplasm.  Breast cancer is a type of cancer which affects the breast tissue which is most commonly from the inner lining of milk ducts or the lobules that supply the ducts with milk

 Breast cancer is caused by a number of factors called risk factors; they are classified as either modifiable (those that can be controlled like habits, environmental hazards, etc) or non-modifiable factors (those that cannot be controlled like, gender, family history etc). 
Other potential risk factors include: family history of breast cancer, age of menarche (first occurrence of menstruation), age of first birth, age of menopause, body weight (BMI), alcohol consumption, exposure to radiation (Poongodi et al, 2011), higher hormonal levels and diet (Yager, 2006).  
 According to Johnson et al (2009) smoking tobacco appears to increase the risk of breast cancer which is higher depending on how long the person has been smoking.  Long term smokers and alcohol consumption have an increased risk of about 35% to 50% (Santoro, 2009).
 
The various ways of detecting breast cancer may include: clinical examination by a physician, self breast examination and mammography.

Support Vector Machines belongs to the class of supervised learning systems. It is one of the best optimization procedures.
 This reduces the over-flowing of the trained data.
 The goal is to find the optimized decision boundaries to predict the breast cancer at the earlier stage.
C-Support Vector Classification Filter (CSVCF) algorithms was used to spot and kill exceptions in breast malignancy survivability information sets.
A least square SVM was proposed for the predictive analysis of breast cancer.
